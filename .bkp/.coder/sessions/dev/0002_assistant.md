It looks like Vite is not installed globally or locally in your project. You need to install the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file. You can do this by running:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies, including Vite. After the installation is complete, you should be able to run `npm run dev` without any issues.

If you still encounter issues, please let me know!
